      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        S&K Steel Furniture is a proudly Malawian furniture manufacturer established in 1966 in Blantyre. 
        The company was born out of a simple yet ambitious dream — to craft durable, comfortable, and stylish 
        furniture locally, at a time when most products were being imported. Starting with only four hardworking 
        individuals in a modest 20x20 ft workshop, the founders laid a strong foundation built on dedication, skill, and 
        the desire to provide reliable furniture solutions for the Malawian people.
      </p>
      <p>In the early years, the company relied mainly on raw materials imported from Zimbabwe and specialized in 
        manufacturing steel furniture such as desks, chairs, and cabinets. 
        As the business grew in reputation and expertise, the company expanded into wood furniture production in the
         early 1970s, combining steel and timber to meet the growing market demand.
      </p>
      <p>
      By the 1980s, S&K Steel Furniture had become one of Malawi’s most respected furniture brands, 
      employing more than 100 skilled workers and supplying products to schools, government institutions,
       banks, and corporate offices across the country. However, as the years went by, the company faced
        new challenges — particularly the influx of cheap imported furniture and the global economic slowdown, 
        which affected local production and sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these difficulties, S&K Steel Furniture remained resilient. Through innovation,
        improved craftsmanship, and a commitment to maintaining local production, the company has 
        continued to serve both public and private sectors with excellence. Today, the company operates with a dedicated team of 
        100 experienced employees, 
        providing customized furniture solutions that meet international standards while reflecting true Malawian workmanship.
